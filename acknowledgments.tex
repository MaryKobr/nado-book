\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Thanks go out to my co-host Aaron van Wirdum for helping me explain the technical stuff in my head. Similarly, my editor Natalye Childress\footnote{https://natalye.com  \MiniQR{HTTPS://BTCWIP.COM/3P}} helped me clarify things even more by transforming the podcast episodes to chapters and asking lots of clarifying questions.

Thanks to Bitcoin Magazine for editing, publishing, promoting, and later even rebranding the podcast.

Ruben Somsen was a co-host for several episodes, including one that made it into the book.

Michael Folkson wrote several of the transcripts for the Taproot activation episodes.

The episode show notes were written by Aaron. They form the basis of appendix A, which describes episodes not covered in the book.

Thanks to Martin Zumsande and others for feedback on earlier drafts.

Finally, thanks to all the Bitcoin Core developers and other volunteers who work to make Bitcoin a success and make my life interesting.
